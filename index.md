## About Me

Hello! I'm Kabir, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego, with a minor in Finance. My journey in tech started out of curiosity and quickly grew into a passion for solving problems and making an impact. Outside academics, you'll find me exploring the intersection of technology and finance, and when I'm not coding, I'm probably out hiking or capturing moments through photography.
